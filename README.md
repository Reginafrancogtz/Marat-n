# Marathon
For my project I would like to design a marathon game that consists of a question and answer dynamic that is played in teams or individually, where participants must demonstrate their knowledge in various categories.
The objective is to accumulate as many points as possible by correctly answering the questions, which can cover topics such as history, geography, general culture and more.
Each correct answer grants points, while incorrect answers can subtract points. As the game progresses, the questions can become more difficult, challenging mental agility and teamwork. 
The purpose of the game is whoever has the most points wins.
In order to create it through c++ the classes that could be integrated could be 1. Question 2. Player 3. Game 4. Timer 5.Answer

Diagram with all the classes, objects, attributes, methods and relationships:
